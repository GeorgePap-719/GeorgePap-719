## Hey there 👋 I'm George

I’m a Senior Software Engineer who likes digging into how systems really work — from the JVM under the hood to async patterns in Kotlin.

Whether I’m building a geo-spatial backend, leading a messaging platform, or experimenting with coroutine-first design, my goal is the same: **make things reliable, fast, and simple.**

I write about software on Medium and share my experiments here on GitHub.

### 🔍 What I’m exploring now
- Async-first systems with coroutines
- Custom database ideas in Kotlin
- Performance and mechanical sympathy

### 🛠 Tech I enjoy
Kotlin • Java • JVM • Coroutines • Distributed Systems • High-throughput backends

🤝 Always open to interesting projects and conversations!
